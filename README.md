# KASHIF MEHMOOD — Portfolio

A multi-page personal portfolio for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub named `kashifmehmood.github.io` (or any repo; see Pages step).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the root of that repo.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set: 
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main` (root)
4. Wait for the Pages build to finish, then open your site.

## Customize

- Update your GitHub profile link in `contact.html` and the navbar footer.
- Replace the placeholder GitHub URL in `python file` with your actual handle.
- Add a profile photo to `assets/img/` and reference it on `index.html` if you like.
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN; no build step required.

## Local preview

Simply open `index.html` in your browser.
